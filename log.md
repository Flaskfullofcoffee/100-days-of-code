# 100 Days of Code â€“ Log

### Day 0: November 20, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Settled on a design

**Thoughts:** To be honest this is really day two and I spent more time than I'd like to admit being critical of my designs, I've realized that as important as design may be to me that it's of greater importance to actually get code written than to spend hours on how it should look.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
